  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  The walking manner of a person, also known as gait, is a unique behavioral biometric trait. Existing methods for gait recognition predominantly utilize traditional machine learning. However, the performance of gait recognition can deteriorate under challenging conditions including environmental occlusion, bulky clothing, and different viewing angles. To provide an effective solution to gait recognition under these conditions, this paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture using Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) that incorporates residual connections for gait recognition from videos. The optimized feature map of the proposed GCNN architecture exhibits the invariant property to viewing angle and subject’s clothing. The residual connection is used to capture both spatial and temporal features of a gait sequence. The kinematic dependency extracted from shallower network layer is propagated to deeper layer using residual connection-based GCNN architecture. The proposed method is validated on CASIA-B gait dataset and outperforms all recent state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handwritten digit recognition is a typical image classification problem. Convolutional neural networks, also known as ConvNets, are powerful classification models for such tasks. As different languages have different styles and shapes of their numeral digits, accuracy rates of the models vary from each other and from language to language. However, unsupervised pre-training in such situation has shown improved accuracy for classification tasks, though no such work has been found for Bangla digit recognition. This paper presents the use of unsupervised pre-training using autoencoder with deep ConvNet in order to recognize handwritten Bangla digits, i.e., 0-9. The datasets that are used in this paper are CMATERDB 3.1.1 and a dataset published by the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). This paper studies four different combinations of these two datasets-two experiments are done against their own training and testing images, other two experiments are done cross validating the datasets. In one of these four experiments, the proposed approach achieves 99.50% accuracy, which is so far the best for recognizing handwritten Bangla digits. The ConvNet model is trained with 19,313 images of ISI handwritten character dataset and tested with images of CMATERDB dataset.

  In a domain of human-machine autonomous systems, gait recognition provides unique advantages over other biometric modalities. It is an unobtrusive, widely-acceptable way of identity, gesture and activity recognition, with applications to surveillance, border control, risk prediction, military training and cybersecurity. Trustworthy and reliable person identification from videos under challenging conditions, when a subject’s walk is occluded by environmental elements, bulky clothing or a viewing angle, is addressed in this paper. It proposes a novel deep learning architecture based on Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) for accurate and reliable gait recognition from videos. The optimized feature map of the proposed GCNN architecture ensures that recognition remains accurate and invariant to viewing angle, type of clothing or other conditions.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial age is an important soft biometric trait for better identification of a human subject. The development of a facial age estimation system requires a large collection of age-labeled data. However, the imbalanced data distribution across age poses a major challenge to making a decent model to describe the variation of facial appearance caused by age. The cross-age data imbalance can be observed in common facial age datasets, for example, the MORPH [8], FG-NET [7] and the MIVIA dataset [3] considered in the GTA Contest. It can be often seen that insufficient data are provided for younger ages and senior ages, and the insufficiency becomes worsened as the age moves close to both ends. To deal with the data imbalance issues, many approaches implement various data augmentation schemes. In our approach, we propose a data augmentation scheme built upon the Age-Style GAN (ASGAN), which we propose for facial age regression and progression. In addition to the ASGAN-based data augmentation, we leverage the mean-variance loss to improve the age classification accuracy, and exploit face alignment as an auxiliary scheme to augment the whole dataset with an aligned subset. We conducted extensive experiments on the MIVIA dataset for verifying the performance of our approach.

  In this paper, we are concerned about the air pollution & Air Quality Index (AQI) level. Today, every major city around the world is facing a worsened situation about public health & environmental disturbance. So, we have proposed an IoT-based solution that evolved with cloud computing platform likes Microsoft Azure, Azure IoT Hub and Azure machine learning (AML). These enhanced the scalability and life cycle of the system. The system classifies the health effects of human life from the air quality index level and gives interactive real-time data visualization results and push notification through the system. We have worked on Dhaka’s air quality dataset. Among major criteria pollutants, we have focused on PM  2.5 , PM  10 , CO, SO  2 , NO  2  that can help us to classify the air quality index level. Multiple classification algorithm is used to train the dataset. Among them, we have acquired the highest accuracy 99.89% with multiclass decision forest.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks - also known as DCNN - are powerful models for different visual pattern classification problems. Many works in this field use image augmentation at the training phase to achieve better accuracy. This paper presents blocky artifact as an augmentation technique to increase the accuracy of DCNN for handwritten digit recognition, both English and Bangla digits, i.e., 0-9. This paper conducts a number of experiments on three different datasets: MNIST Dataset, CMATERDB 3.1.1 Dataset and Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) Dataset. For each dataset, DCNNs with the proposed augmentation technique give better results than those without such augmentation. Unsupervised pre-training with the blocky artifact achieves 99.56%, 99.83% and 99.35% accuracy respectively on MNIST, CMATERDDB and ISI datasets producing, in the process, so far the best accuracy rate for CMATERDB and ISI datasets.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Wireless sensor networks are principally categorized by insufficient energy resource. Naturally, communication between the nodes is the utmost energy consuming act that they perform. Hence, development of a well-organized clustering algorithm can play a vital part in enhancing the lifetime of network. Currently, nature inspired methodologies are very common in dealing with it. This work presents a centralized approach that deals with energy-awareness of wireless sensor networks using the Krill Herd algorithm. The performance of the suggested algorithm is assessed with famous clustering protocols. The simulation results show that suggested approach can maximize sensor network lifetime over other algorithms of the same category.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  In wireless sensor networks, clustering is a very crucial problem. Basically clustering means grouping some specific objects based on their behavior and functionality. Clustering can be formulated for different optimization problems, such as nonsmooth, nonconvex problems. This paper is based on the review of the optimization algorithm that was proposed in the paper A Convergent Incremental Gradient Method With Constant Step Size by Blatt et al called Incremental Aggregate Gradient method. A novel algorithm called Incremental Clustered Aggregate Gradient Method was proposed in this paper to counter the shortcomings of the previous one. It has many similarities with the earlier method but it is more efficient for wireless sensor networks. The main aim of Incremental Gradient Method was to minimize the sum of continuously differentiable functions and also it required a single gradient evaluation per iteration and used a constant step size. For quadratic functions, a global linear rate of convergence was proved. It was claimed that it is more suitable for sensor networks. Although the experiments performed in this work confirm the convergence properties of it, it was found that it is not suitable for sensor networks. The proposed method addresses the flaws of the previous method as regards to sensor networks. When both algorithms operate with their respective optimal step sizes, they require approximately the same number of gradient evaluations for convergence.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in the field of computer vision with the help of deep neural networks have led us to explore and develop many existing challenges that were once unattended due to the lack of necessary technologies. Hand Sign/Gesture Recognition is one of the significant areas where the deep neural network is making a substantial impact. In the last few years, a large number of researches has been conducted to recognize hand signs and hand gestures, which we aim to extend to our mother-tongue, Bangla (also known as Bengali). The primary goal of our work is to make an automated tool to aid the people who are unable to speak. We developed a system that automatically detects hand sign based digits and speaks out the result in Bangla language. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), 15% of people in the world live with some kind of disabilities. Among them, individuals with communication impairment such as speech disabilities experience substantial barrier in social interaction. The proposed system can be invaluable to mitigate such a barrier. The core of the system is built with a deep learning model which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The model classifies hand sign based digits with 92% accuracy over validation data which ensures it a highly trustworthy system. Upon classification of the digits, the resulting output is fed to the text to speech engine and the translator unit eventually which generates audio output in Bangla language.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optical Character Recognition is one of the most prevailing research fields since 1970's. Numerous research work has been conducted on Optical Character Recognition. The problem of Optical Character Recognition is to convert images of texts into editable texts. Recent advances in Deep Learning has accelerated the improvements in this field, particularly with languages with large annotated datasets. Bangla, a language with large number of character classes and complex cursive alphabet shapes, is unfortunately not included in these advancements due to the lack of a large annotated dataset. This work concentrates on attempting to perform OCR in noisy conditions for Bangla text. We have created a dataset of 5000 noisy Bangla text samples. To augment this small collection we use a strategy to pre-train our proposed End-to-End model on synthetically generated data and then optionally fine-tune on a part of the collected dataset. Our results indicate that attempting to perform noisy OCR is an extremely challenging task and the best results are obtained when models trained on synthetic data are fine tuned with some real world data.

  Bangla handwritten character recognition is known to be one of the most classical problem in the field of machine learning. In order to solve a machine learning problem one must thing is dataset. The more varied data a model sees the better it learns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a group of neural networks that are used in unsupervised machine learning. It helps to resolve many difficult operations such as image generation from description, transforming low resolution image into high resolution, retrieving image contents given a small pattern etc. GAN's have many other promising applications in machine learning. There are many variations available for GAN. One of the variation of GAN is Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(cGAN). This kind of GAN is used for generating a specific type of image. In this work we have used cGAN for generating Class Based Character Generation. This work can help researchers to generate handwritten characters to enhance the perfomance of deep learning models. We have trained this model to generate 50 Basic Bangla Characters, 10 Bangla Numerals and 24 Compound characters.

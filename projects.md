## BanglaLekha

Banglalekha was a Govt. funded project for improving the aesthetic quality of Bangla handwriting. Developed the official website of Banglalekha in wordpress (www.banglalekha.org) Developed the official android application of Banglalekha. The application is currently under review of ICT Division, Bangladesh

- Collected a dataset for Bangla handwritten characters
- Developed a architecture for Bangla handwritten character classification
- Developed an Android application for increasing the aesthetic beauty of childrens
- _Tools_: Python, Tensoflow-Keras, OpenCV-Python.

## Bangla News Article Classifier

An Deep Learning based model for classifying Bangla News Articles.  

- Collected a Bangla news article dataset 
- Developed deep learning based solution for the classification
- Render the order summary as a PDF and send it to the user after a successful transaction.
- _Tools_: Python, Tensoflow-Keras, NLTK, OpenCV-Python, MSCOCO-2017 Dataset.

<br/>

## TensorNet

A high-level deep learning library built on top of PyTorch.

- The library contains some advanced concepts like GradCAM and LR Finder into the package so that they can be used via a simple function call.
- Extensive use of code modularization and OOP has been done with proper docstrings for each function in order to maintain a clean and understandable codebase.
- _Tools_: Python, PyTorch.
- _PyPI URL_: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/torch-tensornet/)

## Topic Based Image Captioning

An automatic image caption generation system built using Deep Learning.

- Developed a model which uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics from the image captions.
- Developed a caption generation model using LSTMs which takes the image features from a pre-trained InceptionV3 network and the topics from the LDA-model as input.
- Made the caption generation model using merge model architecture.
- _Tools_: Python, Tensoflow-Keras, NLTK, OpenCV-Python, MSCOCO-2017 Dataset.

## ECom

An E-commerce website built using Django.  

- Built the backend entirely on Django. Used jQuery in some places to make the website asynchronous.
- Used signals, custom model managers, and custom querysets extensively to keep most of the code logic within the models and to make the communication between the linked models effective.
- In case of a server error, setup sendgrid to send a detailed error report to website admins.
- Built the functionality to sell digital items by storing them in AWS S3 Storage.
- Render the order summary as a PDF and send it to the user after a successful transaction.
- _Tools_: Python, Django, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax, jsrender, chart.js

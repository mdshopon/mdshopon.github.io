In order to get started with neural networks please maintain the given flow. First, you need to learn how neural networks work. Implement a simple code for neural networks. 

</br>
#### First, go through these videos. This is the most intuitive explanation you will ever get of neural networks.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w&t=1s
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&t=9s
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8&t=86s<

</br>

#### After this, I am guessing you will get a basic grasp of neural networks. Then you can go through these tutorials.

* https://mlfromscratch.com/neural-networks-explained/#/
* https://blog.goodaudience.com/artificial-neural-networks-explained-436fcf36e75

</br>
#### Now you might have a complete grasp of neural networks. You need to learn Tensorflow/Keras. Here are some of the resources for learning TensorFlow. The best place to learn TensorFlow is their official implementation 
* https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner
* https://youtu.be/tPYj3fFJGjk  (A Long 7 Hour workshop on TensorFlow, very helpful) 
* https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples (Some jupyter notebooks for TensorFlow tutorials)</br>

</br>
#### As now you have the basic understanding of neural networks. Time to learn Convolutional neural network. Go through the following resources. 
* https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/
* https://medium.com/@RaghavPrabhu/understanding-of-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-deep-learning-99760835f148</br>
There are many available resources on the internet. You can take a look at them too.

</br>
#### Now as you have a sufficient amount of ideas CNN. Time to implement this.

* https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn
* https://towardsdatascience.com/tensorflow-2-0-create-and-train-a-vanilla-cnn-on-google-colab-c7a0ac86d61b</br>

</br>
#### After that, now you have to go for the hardest part. Learning Recurrent Neural Networks is the most difficult one. But here are the most useful resources for these.

</br>
Now some auxiliary resources. 
#### How to use Google Colab:
